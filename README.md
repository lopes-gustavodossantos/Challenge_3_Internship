The first one with a background image, title, and two buttons that takes you to the second screen, where you can register in the app, and third screen, where you can do the login. The fourth screen is the home, where we can see to list with plants, with some options to add a plant in your favorites or in your cart. Also in fourth screen you can access your profile, where you have the option to logout.

<br> **How to use:**
>First of all you will need to install Node.js in your machine.
>
>After this, open your Command Prompt and install the Expo with the follow command: npm install -g expo-cli.
>
>With the expo installed open the project folder in the command prompt, after this use the follow command: cd ChallengeIII (ls ChallengeIII on Mac), and in sequence: npm start, to initialize your project.

>When the project start you will be able to see a QR Code and some keyboard shortcuts. With the QR Code you can visualize the app in your on device. And with the shortcuts you will be able to use an emulator in your computer.
